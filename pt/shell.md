## Building your app shell {: #building-your-app-shell }

Structure your app for a clear distinction between the page shell and the dynamic content. In general, your app should load the simplest shell possible but include enough meaningful page content with the initial download. Determine the right balance between speed and data freshness for each of your data sources.

<figure>   <img alt="Offline Wikipedia app using an application shell with content caching" src="images/wikipedia.jpg">   <figcaption>Jake Archibald’s <a href="https://wiki-offline.jakearchibald.com/wiki/Rick_and_Morty">offline Wikipedia application</a> is a good example of a PWA that uses an app shell model. It loads instantly on repeat visits, but dynamically fetches content using JS. This content is then cached offline for future visits. </figcaption></figure>

### Example HTML for an app shell {: #example-html-for-appshell }

This example separates the core application infrastructure and UI from the data. It is important to keep the initial load as simple as possible to display just the page’s layout as soon as the web app is opened. Some of it comes from your application’s index file (inline DOM, styles) and the rest is loaded from external scripts and stylesheets.

All of the UI and infrastructure is cached locally using a service worker so that on subsequent loads, only new or changed data is retrieved, instead of having to load everything.

Your `index.html` file in your work directory should look something like the following code. This is a subset of the actual contents and is not a complete index file. Let's look at what it contains.{br1}new{br1}{br2}new line wer af

- HTML and CSS for the "skeleton" of your user interface complete with navigation and content placeholders.
- An external JavaScript file (app.js) for handling navigation and UI logic as well as the code to display posts retrieved from the server and store them locally using a storage mechanism like IndexedDB.
- A web app manifest and service worker loader to enable off-line capabilities.

Note: See [Your Progressive Web App](/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/) for more on using an application shell and server-side rendering for content. An app shell can be implemented using any library or framework as covered in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srdKq0DckXQ">Progressive Web Apps across all frameworks</a> talk. Samples are available using Polymer (<a href="https://shop.polymer-project.org"><br><br>Shop</a>) and React (<a href="https://github.com/insin/react-hn">ReactHN</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache/tree/master/app-shell-demo">iFixit</a>).

### Caching the application shell {: #app-shell-caching }

An app shell can be cached using a manually written service worker or a generated service worker using a static asset precaching tool like [sw-precache](https://github.com/googlechrome/sw-precache).
