# About GitLocalize

## What is GitLocalize? <a id="what-is-gitlocalize"></a>

Hello, world! 1

[GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/) is a continuous and automated localization platform that simplifies the translation workflow for developers.

Projects are always changing, and keeping them localized can be a daunting \(and annoying\) challenge. We realized this and decided that there should be a way to streamline this. GitLocalize connects to your GitHub repository and seamlessly integrates with your development workflow in just a few clicks

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

### How It Works <a id="how-it-works"></a>

Hello, world! 3

You can immediately get started with your GitHub account. All you have to do is choose your repository to integrate with GitLocalize and localization will become easier than ever before!
